**Developers Only**  
A plugin to place warning notices for plugins or themes that are in active development. Requires PHP 5.3 or greater.

## Description
This is a developer only plugin.

A plugin to place warning notices for plugins or themes that are in active development. Warning notices are placed on the plugins page, the themes page and the core update page.

Provides a warning notice so plugins or themes that are under local development and are updatable from the WordPress repo or other location show a warning message. Updating a plugin or theme under local development may cause data loss.

Hopefully this warning prevents that occurrence.

## Installation
If you use this plugin you really shouldn't need these.

1. Upload the entire `/local-development-upgrade-warning` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin.
